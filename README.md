# Flashcard-Generator

A CLI app that lets users create basic flashcards or cloze-deletion flashcards. Flashcards are stored in log.txt, so that they can be retrieved. After flashcards are created, users can choose to test their knowledge with randomly chosen flashcards from the flashcards created.
